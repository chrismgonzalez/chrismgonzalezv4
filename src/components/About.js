        I am a freelance web developer based in Fort Worth, Texas. I
        have a passion for web development, music, and coffee. I am a music
        educator by day, and a developer by night. I am fascinated by engineering
        complex apps. I love learning new technologies and sharing knowledge
        I have learned with others. Feel free to check out my Github, where I have
        several projects for you to view.
