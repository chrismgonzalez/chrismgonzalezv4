Iâ€™m Chris, a full-stack software developer, technical writer, and music educator in from the great state of Texas. I teach middle school band by day, and am a front-end developer for [Flint Hills Group](https://www.flinthillsgroup.com) by night. When I'm not working on projects for Flint Hills Group, I'm volunteering my time with Operation Code. Operation Code is a non-profit organization that helps active duty military members (and their spouses) transition to roles in the IT industry.  Operation code is very near and dear to my heart.  Without their mentorship and guidance, I would not be the developer I am today.  You can read more about the organization and there mission [here](https://www.operationcode.org).  If  you're looking for to make the jump into open source, they are very beginner friendly, have a WONDERFUL Slack group, and welcome new contributions to their [front-end](https://www.github.com/operationcode/front-end), [back-end](https://www.github.com/operationcode/back-end), and [infrastructure](https://www.github.com/operationcode/operationcode_infra) repositories.

The goal of this site is to not only showcase my work, but provide a place where I can document my learning. The best way for me to learn is to teach others through speaking, writing, and video.  I do not make a dime from this site, so stick around and learn with me. Lastly, I wouldn't be able to produce content and curate this place without the support of my beautiful wife and son.
