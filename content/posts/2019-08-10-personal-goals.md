# Goals for the rest of 2019

If you're reading this page, you have made it to the blog section of my website.  Over the summer of 2019 I revamped my site.  I wanted to include functionality that allowed me to blog without needing something like Contentful or headless Wordpress.

This site is pretty simple really.  Everything you are reading is being pulled in from Markdown files via GraphQL.  It's very powerful and I hope to write about it in the future.

Here are my goals to finish off the rest of 2019:

* Publish blog articles on this site in a tutorial like fashion.  I am learning everything I can about development and I want to share that information with you.
* Build my network - connect with as many people as possible on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisMGDev).  Be sure to smash that follow button and say "Hey!"
* Keep building - Have tons of ideas and a pretty big goal that I am keeping under wraps for now!

If I think of more goals to add, I will definitely update this post.

Peace!

Chris
